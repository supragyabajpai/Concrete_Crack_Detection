# Concrete_Crack_Detection

## Problem:

Develop an automated cracks-in-walls detection system to achieve early detection, consistent monitoring, and cost-effective maintenance for improved structural safety.

## Proposed Solution:

Built an image recognition system (Code and algorithm details provided in the repo); this solution was later deployed with the help of a mobile app and was used by workers at construction companies.
